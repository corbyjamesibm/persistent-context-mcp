- **US-4530**: Template Generation - âœ… AI-enhanced pattern recognition and template creation
- **US-4532**: Full-Text Context Search - âœ… Advanced search with fuzzy matching and highlighting

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Neo4j Graph Database** - Primary storage with relationship modeling
2. **Context Manager Service** - Central orchestration with auto-save capabilities
3. **Search Service** - Full-text indexing with semantic search
4. **Template Generator** - AI-enhanced pattern recognition and template creation
5. **MCP Server** - 8 tools for AI assistant integration
6. **Carbon Design UI** - Responsive React components

### Features Implemented
- âœ… Real-time context persistence with validation
- âœ… Advanced search with fuzzy matching and highlighting
- âœ… Template generation from successful contexts
- âœ… Session management and quick resume
- âœ… Auto-save with retry logic and failure recovery
- âœ… Event-driven service coordination
- âœ… Data integrity validation and auto-repair
- âœ… Connection pooling and performance optimization

## MCP Server Integration ðŸš€

The MCP server provides 8 tools for AI assistants:

1. **save_context** - Save contexts with validation and auto-indexing
2. **search_contexts** - Advanced search with filtering and highlighting  
3. **get_context** - Retrieve specific contexts by ID
4. **generate_template** - Create reusable templates from patterns
5. **apply_template** - Use templates to create new contexts
6. **get_recent_sessions** - Session management and activity tracking
7. **resume_session** - Quick session resume functionality
8. **get_system_status** - Health monitoring and statistics

### Claude Code Integration
The MCP server has been added to Claude Code configuration at:
`~/.claude_code/claude_code.config.json`

**To activate**: Restart Claude Code to access the persistent context store tools.

- Connection pooling with automatic reconnection
- Cypher query optimization for performance
- Relationship modeling for context links

### Search Capabilities  
- Full-text indexing with token analysis
- Fuzzy matching with configurable similarity thresholds
- Semantic search with contextual relevance scoring
- Faceted filtering by type, tags, and date ranges
- Search result highlighting with match context

### Template System
- AI-enhanced pattern recognition from successful contexts
- Variable extraction with confidence scoring
- Template validation and reusability analysis
- Dynamic template application with variable substitution

### Performance & Reliability
- Event-driven architecture with service coordination
- Auto-save with exponential backoff retry logic
- Data validation with automatic repair capabilities
- Graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Connection pooling for optimal database performance

## Testing & Validation

All components have been thoroughly tested:
- âœ… Neo4j database connectivity and operations
- âœ… Service integration and event coordination
- âœ… MCP server startup and tool availability
