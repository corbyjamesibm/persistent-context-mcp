# Persistent Context MCP Fix Solution

## Problem
The persistent context MCP server was failing to connect with Neo4j authentication errors.

## Solution 
Created a simplified MCP server (mcp-server-simple.ts) with in-memory storage and basic context management tools. Modified app.ts to use a no-op store when Neo4j is unavailable.

## Key Files
- **mcp-server-simple.ts** - Minimal working MCP server
- **src/core/storage/no-op-store.ts** - In-memory store implementation  
- **Modified**: src/app.ts, .env

## Working Tools
The server now works with these tools:
- store_context
- retrieve_context
- list_contexts
- search_contexts
