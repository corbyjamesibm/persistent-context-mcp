# RTE Context Update Summary

## Date: January 29, 2025

## Updates Made to Enable Sprint Overlap Detection and Fixing

### 1. **New Operation Created: fix-sprint-overlaps**
- **File**: `src/operations/pi-planning/fix-sprint-overlaps.ts`
- **Purpose**: Detect and automatically fix overlapping sprint dates
- **Features**:
  - Detects overlaps across all teams in a PI
  - Validation-only mode to preview issues
  - Auto-fix mode to correct overlaps
  - Maintains 14-day sprint duration
  - Ensures no gaps between sprints
  - Handles multiple teams simultaneously

### 2. **RTE Personality Configuration Updated**
- **File**: `config/personalities/release-train-engineer.json`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `fix-sprint-overlaps` to availableOperations
  - Added to piSetup workflow hint
  - Added new piMaintenance workflow hint
  - Enhanced date validation constraints
  - Added sprint overlap as a known issue with solution

### 3. **Integration Updates**
- **File**: `src/operations/pi-planning/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported FixSprintOverlapsOperation
  - Added to operations registry
  - Exported for direct use

### 4. **RTE Context Documentation Updated**
- **File**: `RTE_PI_CONFIGURATION_CONTEXT.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Added sprint overlap rule to Date Logic
  - Added validation code for overlap detection
  - Created new "Critical Sprint Date Rules" section
  - Added fix-sprint-overlaps command examples
  - Updated file modification list
  - Added update timestamp

### 5. **Sprint Schedule Documentation**
- **File**: `/persistent-context-store/sprint-dates-report-updated.md`
- **Content**: Complete non-overlapping sprint schedule for all teams

## Key Capability Added

The RTE can now:
1. **Detect** sprint date overlaps using: `fix-sprint-overlaps --validateOnly=true`
2. **Fix** sprint date overlaps using: `fix-sprint-overlaps --autoFix=true`

## Example Usage

```bash
# Check for overlaps
fix-sprint-overlaps --artName="AI for Everyone" --piNumber=1 --validateOnly=true

# Fix overlaps automatically
fix-sprint-overlaps --artName="AI for Everyone" --piNumber=1 --autoFix=true
```

## Technical Implementation

The operation:
- Groups sprints by team
- Sorts by sprint number
- Detects date overlaps
- Calculates correct sequential dates
- Updates each sprint with proper dates
- Reports success/failure for each update

## Result

The RTE persona now has full capability to manage sprint date boundaries, ensuring proper SAFe compliance with non-overlapping sprints across all teams in an ART.
